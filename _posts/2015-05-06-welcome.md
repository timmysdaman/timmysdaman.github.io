Welcome to my blog, reader! This blog has the potential to contain all sorts of material related to technology, such as:
 
- Reviews and examples of the latest and greatest technology.
- My Love of OO development (even though its pretty ancient by today's standards)
- Philosophizing about what makes great software teams (a la Demarco and Lister's <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Teams-3rd/dp/0321934113/'><i>Peopleware</i></a>)
- Salesforce and Salesfore Marketing Cloud, because that's my day job.
- At least a few posts on beer
- Best Practices 

<br>
So, sit down, grab a pint, and enjoy the musings.
